Contribution Statement - Stella Bakac

For this project, the initial plan was to complete it collaboratively with my group. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to complete the majority of the work on my own to ensure the project was finalized on time.

Here’s a breakdown of my contributions:

Gameplay mechanics and scripting: I implemented the main gameplay features, including player movement, collision handling, and interaction with objects (keys and rocks). I wrote and debugged the scripts for the bike controller, collision handling, and UI management.
UI Development: I designed and created the main menu, buttons, and game UI, ensuring it adhered to the project requirements and was functional.
Audio Implementation: I added background music and sound effects for object interactions to enhance the game’s atmosphere.
Assets and Scene Design: I imported assets, added colliders for objects, and configured the environment to ensure it was both visually engaging and functional for the gameplay experience.
Problem-solving and debugging: I spent considerable time addressing technical issues, such as rigidbody errors and collider setup, to make the game playable.
While this project was initially a group effort, I took the lead and ensured all required components were implemented. Any group members not featured in the demo video were not actively involved in the project’s completion.

This project reflects my best effort under challenging circumstances, and I hope it meets the expectations of the course
